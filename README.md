Electric Vehicle sales in India
This project displays the state-wise sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in India from 2018 to 2025. It includes various charts to visualize this data. I've also detailed the advantages and disadvantages of this trend within my HTML file and uploaded a report in PDF format. Furthermore, the project forecasts future electric vehicle sales and presents ideas for the future of EVs in India, all elaborated within the project and its accompanying report.\

This report also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of electric vehicle sales, both currently and in the future. It demonstrates how electric vehicles have grown in popularity over the past few years and how they are expected to further expand in the market in the coming years.

 Advantages
 Environmental Friendly: Zero tailpipe emissions mean cleaner air and reduced 
carbon footprint.
 High Mobility in Tier-2, Tier-3 Cities: Ideal for commutes and increasingly 
popular due to affordability and improving infrastructure.
 Less Running Cost: Significantly cheaper to "refuel" (charge) and require 
minimal maintenance, saving money.

Disadvantages
 Electric vehicles often have a high upfront cost, and they don't seem to fetch a good 
price in the second-hand market either."
 Limited Charging Infrastructure: The availability of public charging stations, 
especially fast chargers, is still insufficient across India. This creates "range 
anxiety" and inconvenience for EV owners, making long-distance travel 
challenging compared to the widespread network of petrol pumps.
