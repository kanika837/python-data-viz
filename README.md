Electric Vehicle sales in India
This project displays the state-wise sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in India from 2018 to 2025. It includes various charts to visualize this data. I've also detailed the advantages and disadvantages of this trend within my HTML file and uploaded a report in PDF format. Furthermore, the project forecasts future electric vehicle sales and presents ideas for the future of EVs in India, all elaborated within the project and its accompanying report.
