This project provides a detailed analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across India, utilizing a meticulously curated dataset. The primary goal is to empower financial analysts, data scientists, and researchers with the necessary insights to understand the evolving EV market in the country. 
The dataset, which was sourced from the Clean Mobility Shift website and preprocessed for immediate use, is versatile and can be used for geographic market segmentation, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.

The analysis aims to support strategic decision-making in several key areas:

 * Market Planning: By offering insights into regional EV sales patterns, the dataset helps in developing targeted market strategies.
   
 * Infrastructure Investment: The data can guide decisions on where to invest in charging infrastructure and other related facilities.
   
 * Policy Development: The dataset is valuable for developing and evaluating policies within the EV sector.


   
The dataset is provided in a CSV format and includes state-level data on EV sales, vehicle types, and categories, offering a comprehensive view of EV distribution across Indian states.

It contains the following key features:

 * State: The names of Indian states with recorded EV sales data.
   
 * Vehicle Type: Classifications like two-wheelers and four-wheelers.
   
 * Vehicle Category: Further classification into segments such as commercial and passenger vehicles.
   
 * Electric_Vehicle_Sales_Quantity: The number of EVs sold per state, which is crucial for analyzing adoption trends.

 Advantages

 Environmental Friendly: Zero tailpipe emissions mean cleaner air and reduced 
carbon footprint.

 High Mobility in Tier-2, Tier-3 Cities: Ideal for commutes and increasingly 
popular due to affordability and improving infrastructure.

 Less Running Cost: Significantly cheaper to "refuel" (charge) and require 
minimal maintenance, saving money.



Disadvantages

 Electric vehicles often have a high upfront cost, and they don't seem to fetch a good 
price in the second-hand market either."

 Limited Charging Infrastructure: The availability of public charging stations, 
especially fast chargers, is still insufficient across India. This creates "range 
anxiety" and inconvenience for EV owners, making long-distance travel 
challenging compared to the widespread network of petrol pumps.
